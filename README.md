Lab 5 

# Part 1

This part of the lab involved understanding the following PRISM code as it would appear as a waveform.

The code above would load a value of 8 into the accumulator, add 1 to this value, the output the new value to output port 3. It loops back to the addition portion causing an output from 9 to F.  The following waveform demonstrates this code.
